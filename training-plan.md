# Training Plan: Half Marathon in 12 Weeks

## Goal Summary
- **Distance**: Half Marathon (13.1 miles)
- **Target Time**: 1:23:00 (83 minutes)
- **Target Pace**: 6:19/mile
- **Training Days**: 3 days per week
- **Plan Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Current Base**: 15-25 miles/week
- **Experience Level**: Experienced runner (3+ years)

## Training Paces

Use these paces for workouts throughout the plan:

| Pace Type | Description | Pace Range | Effort (RPE) |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Easy (E) | Recovery and aerobic development | 7:35 - 8:13/mile | 2-4/10 |
| Steady (S) | Aerobic endurance | 6:57 - 7:16/mile | 4-5/10 |
| Threshold (T) | Comfortably hard, sustainable | 6:04 - 6:19/mile | 6-7/10 |
| Interval (I) | VO₂max, hard but repeatable | 5:41 - 5:55/mile | 8-9/10 |
| Repetition (R) | Short, fast reps | 5:31 - 5:44/mile | Fast/crisp |
| Half Marathon (HM) Pace | Target race effort | 6:19/mile | Race effort |

**Note**: Adjust paces for terrain, weather, and how you feel. These are guidelines, not rigid rules. Hills, heat, and fatigue will naturally slow paces - that's expected and appropriate.

## Plan Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation with Quality (Weeks 1-3)
**Focus**: Build volume foundation while introducing meaningful threshold work
**Volume**: 25-30 miles per week
**Key Sessions**: Threshold intervals, easy long runs, volume building

### Phase 2: Build (Weeks 4-7)
**Focus**: Expand aerobic capacity and introduce race-specific pacing
**Volume**: 32-38 miles per week (with recovery week 4)
**Key Sessions**: VO₂max intervals, longer threshold work, progressive long runs

### Phase 3: Specific/Peak (Weeks 9-11)
**Focus**: Half marathon pace durability and race-specific fitness
**Volume**: 38-42 miles per week
**Key Sessions**: Extended HM pace work, long runs with quality segments

### Phase 4: Taper (Week 12)
**Focus**: Reduce fatigue, maintain sharpness, arrive fresh
**Volume**: ~25 miles
**Key Sessions**: One short sharpening workout, easy running, race day

## Week-by-Week Training Schedule

### Week 1: Foundation with Quality
**Total Volume**: 24.5 miles
**Focus**: Establish routine with immediate quality work

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Threshold - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 3 x 1 mile @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 0.25 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 6.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 8 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13) + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 10 miles easy @ E pace

**Notes**: Start strong but controlled. The threshold work should feel comfortably hard, not all-out. Save energy for the long run.

- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 14.5 miles, last 3 miles @ steady pace (6:57-7:16)

**Notes**: The 2-mile threshold reps build mental and physical endurance. The long run finish should feel controlled, not desperate.

---

### Week 7: Build Phase

## Important Notes

### Easy Days Should Feel Easy
With only 3 training days per week, recovery between sessions happens during your rest days. Your easy pace (7:35-8:13) should feel genuinely comfortable - you should be able to hold a full conversation. Don't let ego creep into easy runs. The goal is aerobic development and recovery, not proving toughness.

### Fueling and Hydration
- Practice fueling during long runs starting in Week 6
- Target 30-60g carbohydrates per hour on runs over 90 minutes
- Test different fuel sources (gels, chews, liquids) during training
- Never try anything new on race day
- Stay hydrated but don't over-drink

### Strength Training
With 3 running days, you have 4 rest days available. Consider adding:
- 1-2 strength sessions per week (focus on single-leg strength, core stability, glute activation)
- Schedule strength after easy runs or on full rest days
- Reduce strength volume during taper (Week 11-12)
- Prioritize running over lifting - if you're too sore to run well, skip the gym

### Listen to Your Body
This plan is aggressive given your current 15-25 mile base and only 3 training days. Watch for:
- Persistent soreness or pain (beyond normal training fatigue)
- Poor sleep or elevated resting heart rate
- Loss of motivation or declining performance
- Illness or excessive life stress

**If you're struggling**:
- Skip the second interval/threshold session and make it easy
- Reduce long run distance by 10-15%
- Take an extra rest day
- Insert an additional recovery week if needed

### Adjust as Needed
This plan assumes:
- You're healthy and injury-free
- Your life stress is manageable
- You can execute quality sessions properly

If circumstances change (injury, illness, work stress, family obligations), adjust accordingly. It's better to arrive at the start line 90% trained and 100% healthy than 100% trained and breaking down.

### About the 83-Minute Goal
An 83-minute half marathon (6:19/mile pace) is an ambitious target that requires:
- Strong aerobic fitness
- Good lactate threshold
- Mental toughness to sustain pace

If you're currently running 15-25 miles per week, this will be a significant step up in both volume and intensity. Recent race times (10K, 5K) can help validate whether this goal is realistic. A general rule of thumb:
- 10K time x 2.1 + 30-60 seconds = HM estimate
- Example: 40:00 10K suggests 1:24-1:25 HM

Be prepared to adjust your race day goal based on how training goes. The fitness will come - trust the process.

### Race Day Strategy
- Start conservatively - aim for 6:20-6:22 for the first 3 miles
- Settle into 6:19 pace for miles 4-10
- If you feel strong at mile 10, gradually increase effort
- Practice your race pace during workouts so it feels natural
- Have a Plan B if conditions are tough (heat, wind, hills)

**Good luck with your training!**
