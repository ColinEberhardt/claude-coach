# Training Plan: Half Marathon in 12 Weeks

## Goal Summary
- **Distance**: Half Marathon (13.1 miles)
- **Target Time**: 1:23:00 (83 minutes)
- **Target Pace**: 6:19/mile
- **Training Days**: 3 days per week
- **Plan Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Current Base**: 15-25 miles/week

## Training Paces

Use these paces for workouts throughout the plan:

| Pace Type | Description | Pace Range | Effort (RPE) |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Easy (E) | Recovery and aerobic development | 7:35-8:13/mile | 2-4/10 |
| Steady (S) | Aerobic endurance | 6:57-7:16/mile | 4-5/10 |
| Threshold (T) | Comfortably hard, sustainable | 6:04-6:19/mile | 6-7/10 |
| Interval (I) | VO₂max, hard but repeatable | 5:41-5:55/mile | 8-9/10 |
| Repetition (R) | Short, fast reps | 5:31-5:44/mile | Fast/crisp |
| Half Marathon (HM) Pace | Target race effort | 6:19/mile | Race effort |

**Note**: Adjust paces for terrain, weather, and how you feel. These are guidelines. On hilly terrain, run by effort rather than strict pace.

## Important Considerations

**About This Plan**: An 83-minute half marathon is a highly competitive goal requiring significant speed and endurance. With 3 training days per week, each session must be purposeful and executed well. This plan assumes you have:
- Recent running consistency (the 15-25 mpw base)
- Previous experience with speed work
- No current injuries
- Ability to recover between hard efforts

**If you're new to structured training**: Consider targeting 90-95 minutes for your first half marathon, which allows more gradual progression.

## Plan Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Focus**: Build aerobic base, introduce threshold work
**Volume**: 22-28 miles/week
**Key Sessions**: Easy mileage, tempo runs, progressive long runs

### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 5-8)
**Focus**: Increase intensity, add race pace and VO₂max work
**Volume**: 28-35 miles/week
**Key Sessions**: Longer threshold efforts, race pace segments, quality long runs

### Phase 3: Peak (Weeks 9-10)
**Focus**: Race-specific preparation at HM pace
**Volume**: 35-38 miles/week
**Key Sessions**: Extended HM pace work, tune-up race or time trial

### Phase 4: Taper (Weeks 11-12)
**Focus**: Reduce fatigue while maintaining sharpness
**Volume**: 25 miles (Week 11), 15 miles (Week 12)
**Key Sessions**: Short, sharp efforts to maintain leg speed

## Week-by-Week Training Schedule

### Week 1: Foundation
**Total Volume**: 22 miles
**Focus**: Establish routine, build aerobic base

- **Tuesday**: Easy 6 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13/mile) + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Tempo Run - 1 mile easy warm-up, 3 miles @ S pace (6:57-7:16/mile), 1 mile easy cool-down = 5 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 11 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13/mile)

**Notes**: Focus on feeling comfortable at easy pace. Strides are 20-30 second accelerations to about 5K pace with full recovery walk back.

---

### Week 2: Foundation
**Total Volume**: 24 miles
**Focus**: Slight volume increase, maintain consistency

- **Tuesday**: Easy 7 miles @ E pace + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Threshold - 1 mile easy warm-up, 2 x 2 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19/mile) with 2 min jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down = 6 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 11 miles @ E pace

**Notes**: The threshold segments should feel "comfortably hard" - you could speak a few words but not hold a conversation.

---

### Week 3: Foundation
**Total Volume**: 27 miles
**Focus**: Build volume, introduce longer tempo

- **Tuesday**: Easy 8 miles @ E pace + 8 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Tempo Run - 1 mile easy warm-up, 4 miles @ S pace (6:57-7:16/mile), 1 mile easy cool-down = 6 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 13 miles @ E pace, last 2 miles @ S pace

**Notes**: The long run with faster finish prepares you for running on tired legs. Keep the first 11 miles genuinely easy.

---

### Week 4: Foundation (Recovery Week)
**Total Volume**: 23 miles
**Focus**: Absorb training, prepare for intensity phase

- **Tuesday**: Easy 6 miles @ E pace + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Easy 7 miles @ E pace
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 10 miles @ E pace

**Notes**: Recovery week - don't feel guilty about easier volume. You're building fitness during rest.

---

### Week 5: Development
**Total Volume**: 27 miles
**Focus**: Introduce VO₂max intervals, increase specificity

- **Tuesday**: Easy 8 miles @ E pace + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Intervals - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 5 x 1km @ I pace (5:41-5:55/mile = 3:32-3:40 per km) with 400m jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down = 6.6 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 12.5 miles @ E pace, last 3 miles @ S pace

**Notes**: The 1km intervals are at VO₂max effort. Focus on consistent splits across all repeats. 400m recovery should be about 2:30-3:00.

---

### Week 6: Development
**Total Volume**: 31 miles
**Focus**: Race pace introduction, extend threshold work

- **Tuesday**: Easy 9 miles @ E pace + 8 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Race Pace - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 3 x 2 miles @ HM pace (6:19/mile) with 0.5 mile jog recovery (4 min), 1 mile easy cool-down = 9.5 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 12.5 miles @ E pace

**Notes**: Race pace segments should feel controlled and sustainable. If you're struggling, these segments are too fast.

---

### Week 7: Development
**Total Volume**: 34 miles
**Focus**: Peak volume week with quality

- **Tuesday**: Easy 10 miles @ E pace + 8 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Threshold - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 5 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19/mile), 1.5 mile easy cool-down = 8 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 16 miles @ E pace, last 4 miles @ S pace

**Notes**: This is your highest volume week. The 5-mile threshold is a significant effort - pace yourself and stay relaxed.

---

### Week 8: Development (Recovery Week)
**Total Volume**: 26 miles
**Focus**: Recover before peak phase

- **Tuesday**: Easy 7 miles @ E pace + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Easy 9 miles @ E pace
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 10 miles @ E pace

**Notes**: Another recovery week. Trust the process - you'll feel fresh for the peak phase.

---

### Week 9: Peak
**Total Volume**: 36 miles
**Focus**: Race-specific preparation, extended HM pace

- **Tuesday**: Easy 10 miles @ E pace + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Race Pace - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 10 miles @ HM pace (6:19/mile), 1 mile easy cool-down = 12.5 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 13.5 miles @ E pace

**Notes**: The 10-mile race pace effort is the key workout of your plan. This simulates most of the race distance. Start conservatively and build into it.

---

### Week 10: Peak
**Total Volume**: 35 miles
**Focus**: Tune-up race or time trial

- **Tuesday**: Easy 8 miles @ E pace + 8 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Tune-Up Race - 10K race or time trial at max effort (target ~38-40 minutes if fitness is on track)
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 15 miles @ E pace

**Notes**: The 10K race/time trial tests your fitness and practices race day execution. Don't overpace - use it as data, not a hero workout.

---

### Week 11: Taper
**Total Volume**: 25 miles
**Focus**: Reduce fatigue, maintain sharpness

- **Tuesday**: Easy 6 miles @ E pace + 6 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Sharpener - 1 mile easy warm-up, 3 x 1 mile @ HM pace (6:19/mile) with 2 min jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down = 5 miles total
- **Sunday**: Long Run - 10 miles @ E pace, last 2 miles @ S pace

**Notes**: You should start feeling fresh this week. Don't panic about reduced volume - you can't gain fitness this close to race day.

---

### Week 12: Race Week
**Total Volume**: 15 miles + race (13.1 miles)
**Focus**: Stay loose, execute race plan

- **Tuesday**: Easy 5 miles @ E pace + 4 x 100m strides
- **Thursday**: Sharpener - 1 mile easy, 6 x 400m @ HM pace (6:19/mile = 95 sec per 400m) with 200m jog recovery, 1 mile easy = 4 miles total
- **Friday**: Rest or 20-minute easy shakeout
- **Saturday**: Rest or 20-minute easy shakeout with 3 x 100m strides
- **Sunday**: **RACE DAY** - Half Marathon (13.1 miles)

**Notes**: Trust your training. Start conservatively - the first 5K should feel controlled. You'll race the second half, not the first.

---

## Race Day Strategy

**Pacing Plan**:
- **Miles 1-3**: 6:25-6:30/mile (5-10 seconds slower than goal pace) - settle in, don't get caught up in the crowd
- **Miles 4-10**: 6:19-6:22/mile (right at or slightly faster than goal pace) - find your rhythm, stay relaxed
- **Miles 11-13.1**: 6:15-6:19/mile (maintain or push if feeling strong) - this is where your training pays off

**Fuel and Hydration**:
- Take water at aid stations from mile 3 onward (small sips)
- Consider a gel at mile 7-8 if the race is warm or if you typically use fuel
- Practice this in your longer race pace workouts

**Mental Approach**:
- Break the race into thirds: first third controlled, second third focused, final third committed
- When it gets hard (it will around mile 9-10), focus on form and breathing, not the pain
- Remember: you've run 10 miles at this pace in training - you can hold it for 13.1

## Important Notes

**Easy days should feel easy**: Most runners run their easy days too hard. Your easy pace should allow you to hold a conversation. If you're breathing hard, slow down. Easy running builds your aerobic engine.

**The 3-day structure**: With only 3 training days, recovery is built into your week. However, you can add optional cross-training (cycling, swimming, elliptical) on 1-2 off days if desired, keeping it truly easy (conversational effort).

**Strength training**: Consider adding 20-30 minutes of strength work 1-2x per week focusing on: single-leg squats, lunges, calf raises, planks, and glute bridges. Do this after easy runs or on off days, never before hard workouts.

**Listen to your body**:
- If you feel a sharp pain or unusual discomfort, stop and assess
- If you're unusually tired, take an extra rest day and resume when fresh
- Missing one workout won't hurt your race; running through injury will

**Adjust as needed**:
- If a workout feels too hard, slow down or reduce the volume (fewer repeats or shorter distance)
- Weather impacts: on very hot or very cold days, adjust paces by 10-20 seconds per mile
- If you miss a workout, don't try to make it up - just continue with the next scheduled session

**Regarding the goal**: An 83-minute half marathon is an excellent goal, but it requires consistent execution of this plan. If after Week 6-7 the workouts feel unsustainable, consider adjusting your goal to 85-87 minutes. Be honest with yourself about your fitness.

**Post-race**: After the race, take 1-2 weeks very easy (short easy runs only), then resume structured training if you have another goal.

## Final Thoughts

This plan is aggressive given the time constraints (3 days/week) and the goal pace. Success requires:
- Executing every workout as prescribed (not faster, not harder)
- Prioritizing recovery (sleep, nutrition, stress management)
- Building mental toughness - many of these workouts will be challenging
- Trusting the process through recovery weeks

You have the structure to achieve 83 minutes. Now it's about consistent execution, one workout at a time.

Good luck with your training!
