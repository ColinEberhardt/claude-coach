# Training Plan: Half Marathon in 12 Weeks

## Goal Summary
- **Distance**: Half Marathon (13.1 miles)
- **Target Time**: 1:23:00 (83 minutes)
- **Target Pace**: 6:19/mile
- **Training Days**: 3 days per week
- **Plan Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Current Base**: 15-25 miles/week
- **Experience Level**: Experienced runner (3+ years)

## Training Paces

Use these paces for workouts throughout the plan:

| Pace Type | Description | Pace Range | Effort (RPE) |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Easy (E) | Recovery and aerobic development | 7:35 - 8:13/mile | 2-4/10 |
| Steady (S) | Aerobic endurance | 6:57 - 7:16/mile | 4-5/10 |
| Threshold (T) | Comfortably hard, sustainable | 6:04 - 6:19/mile | 6-7/10 |
| Interval (I) | VO₂max, hard but repeatable | 5:41 - 5:55/mile | 8-9/10 |
| Repetition (R) | Short, fast reps | 5:31 - 5:44/mile | Fast/crisp |
| Half Marathon (HM) Pace | Target race effort | 6:19/mile | Race effort |

**Note**: Adjust paces for terrain, weather, and how you feel. These are guidelines, not rigid rules. Hills, heat, and fatigue will naturally slow paces - that's expected and appropriate.

## Plan Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation with Quality (Weeks 1-3)
**Focus**: Build volume foundation while introducing meaningful threshold work
**Volume**: 25-30 miles per week
**Key Sessions**: Threshold intervals, easy long runs, volume building

### Phase 2: Build (Weeks 4-7)
**Focus**: Expand aerobic capacity and introduce race-specific pacing
**Volume**: 32-38 miles per week (with recovery week 4)
**Key Sessions**: VO₂max intervals, longer threshold work, progressive long runs

### Phase 3: Specific/Peak (Weeks 9-11)
**Focus**: Half marathon pace durability and race-specific fitness
**Volume**: 38-42 miles per week
**Key Sessions**: Extended HM pace work, long runs with quality segments

### Phase 4: Taper (Week 12)
**Focus**: Reduce fatigue, maintain sharpness, arrive fresh
**Volume**: ~25 miles
**Key Sessions**: One short sharpening workout, easy running, race day

## Week-by-Week Training Schedule

### Week 1 (Starting January 19, 2025): Foundation with Quality
**Total Volume**: 24.5 miles
**Focus**: Establish routine with immediate quality work

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Threshold - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 3 x 1 mile @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 0.25 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 6.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 8 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13) + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 10 miles easy @ E pace

**Notes**: Start strong but controlled. The threshold work should feel comfortably hard, not all-out. Save energy for the long run.

---

### Week 2 (Starting January 26, 2025): Foundation with Quality
**Total Volume**: 28 miles
**Focus**: Introduce VO₂max work, continue building volume

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Intervals - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 6 x 1km @ I pace (5:41-5:55), 400m jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 7.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 9 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 11.5 miles easy @ E pace

**Notes**: The 1km intervals should feel hard but repeatable. Focus on consistent splits rather than crushing the first rep.

---

### Week 3 (Starting February 2, 2025): Foundation with Quality
**Total Volume**: 33.5-34.5 miles
**Focus**: Build threshold endurance, aerobic volume, race stimulus

- **Day 1 (Mon, Feb 3)**: Threshold - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 4 x 1 mile @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 0.25 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 7.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Tue, Feb 4)**: Easy 12 miles @ recovery pace (~9:00/mile) - keep this VERY easy, slower than normal easy pace
- **Day 3 (Wed, Feb 5)**: Easy 8 miles @ recovery pace (~9:00/mile) - again, keep this genuinely easy
- **Day 4 (Thu/Fri, Feb 6-7)**: Rest days - stay off your feet before parkrun
- **Day 5 (Sat, Feb 8)**: York Parkrun - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, race 5K hard, 1.5 mile easy cool-down (Total: 6.5-7 miles)

**Notes**: Modified week to accommodate York parkrun opportunity. Tuesday and Wednesday runs are deliberately slower than normal easy pace (9:00/mile vs 7:35-8:13) to bank aerobic volume without creating fatigue. This gives you five days between hard efforts (Monday threshold to Saturday parkrun). The parkrun replaces the long run - you're trading easy aerobic volume for race-specific stimulus. Stick to the recovery pace discipline on Tue/Wed or you'll compromise Saturday's performance.

---

### Week 4 (Starting February 9, 2026): Modified Build Week
**Total Volume**: 28.5 miles
**Focus**: VO2max development and volume building

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Intervals - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 4 x 1 mile @ I pace (5:41-5:55), 0.25 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 7.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 9 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 12 miles easy @ E pace

**Notes**: Modified from original recovery week plan. Week 3 parkrun was missed, resulting in 4 days rest and full recovery. Athlete feeling strong and ready for increased volume AND intensity. VO2max intervals chosen over tempo work to provide speed stimulus. Start conservatively (aim for 5:50 first rep) and assess. Keep easy runs genuinely easy - the interval work is demanding.

---

### Week 5 (Starting February 16, 2025): Build Phase
**Total Volume**: 32 miles
**Focus**: Return to volume with VO₂max emphasis

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Intervals - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 5 x 1 mile @ I pace (5:41-5:55), 0.25 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 8.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy/Moderate 10 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 13.5 miles easy @ E pace

**Notes**: Mile repeats at VO₂max pace build aerobic power. Keep recoveries active (jog, don't stand).

---

### Week 6 (Starting February 23, 2025): Build Phase
**Total Volume**: 35 miles
**Focus**: Longer threshold blocks, introduce quality into long run

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Threshold - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 3 x 2 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 0.5 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 9.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 11 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 14.5 miles, last 3 miles @ steady pace (6:57-7:16)

**Notes**: The 2-mile threshold reps build mental and physical endurance. The long run finish should feel controlled, not desperate.

---

### Week 7 (Starting March 2, 2025): Build Phase - 12K Trail Race Week
**Total Volume**: ~32-35 miles
**Focus**: 12K trail race on March 8 (race effort, not a taper)

- **Day 1 (Sun/Mon, March 2/3)**: Easy 8-9 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 2 (Tue/Wed, March 4/5)**: Threshold - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 2 x 2 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 0.5 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 7.5 miles)
- **Day 3 (Thu, March 6)**: Easy 5-6 miles @ E pace (conversational, keep legs fresh)
- **Day 4 (Fri, March 7)**: Shakeout - 4 miles very easy + 4-6 short strides (pre-race prep)
- **Day 5 (Sat, March 8)**: **12K TRAIL RACE** - 1.5-2 mile easy warm-up, RACE EFFORT, 1.5-2 mile easy cool-down (Total: ~11-12 miles with race)

**Notes**: Modified week to accommodate proper racing effort. Reduced Tuesday workout to 2x2 (from 3x2) to arrive fresh. Trail racing provides excellent neuromuscular stimulus and economy work. Race the 12K hard - the varied terrain and effort will be great training. Week 8 recovery week follows perfectly.

---

### Week 8 (Starting March 9, 2025): Recovery Week
**Total Volume**: 28 miles
**Focus**: Recover from 3-week build, prepare for specific phase

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Tempo - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 5 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 7.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 8.5 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 12 miles easy @ E pace

**Notes**: Second recovery week. Let your body absorb the hard training. You should feel sharp and ready for the specific phase.

---

### Week 9 (Starting March 16, 2025): Specific Phase
**Total Volume**: 40 miles
**Focus**: HM pace durability, structured long run quality

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: HM Pace - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 4 x 1.5 miles @ HM pace (6:19), 0.5 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 10 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 12 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 18 miles, last 6 miles @ steady pace (6:57-7:16)

**Notes**: High-quality work. The HM pace reps should feel very race-specific. Practice fueling on the long run.

---

### Week 10 (Starting March 23, 2025): Specific Phase - Peak Week
**Total Volume**: 42 miles
**Focus**: Maximum race-specific preparation, longest long run

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Mixed Quality - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 2 x 2 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19), 2 x 1 mile @ HM pace (6:19), 0.5 mile jog recovery between all reps, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 10 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 13 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 19 miles, middle 10 miles @ steady pace (6:57-7:16)

**Notes**: This is your peak week. The mixed quality workout simulates race fatigue. The long run with extended steady pace is your biggest confidence builder.

---

### Week 11 (Starting March 30, 2025): Specific Phase
**Total Volume**: 38 miles
**Focus**: Final race-specific sharpening, begin volume reduction

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: HM Pace - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 5 x 1 mile @ HM pace (6:19), 0.25 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 8 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 12 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun)**: Long Run - 18 miles, last 8 miles @ HM effort (6:19-6:30)

**Notes**: Final big week. The long run finish should feel like race pace or slightly easier. You're practicing the race, not testing it.

---

### Week 12 (Starting April 6, 2025): Taper
**Total Volume**: ~25 miles (including race)
**Focus**: Freshen up, maintain sharpness, arrive ready

- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed)**: Sharpener - 1.5 mile easy warm-up, 3 x 1 mile @ HM pace (6:19), 0.5 mile jog recovery, 1 mile easy cool-down (Total: 6.5 miles)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri)**: Easy 5 miles @ E pace + 4 strides (keep it short and snappy)
- **Day 3 (Race Day - Sat/Sun)**: Half Marathon Race - 13.1 miles @ goal pace (6:19/mile)

**Notes**: Trust your training. The work is done. The sharpener keeps your legs feeling fast without creating fatigue. Stay off your feet the day before the race. Execute your race plan with confidence.

## Important Notes

### Easy Days Should Feel Easy
With only 3 training days per week, recovery between sessions happens during your rest days. Your easy pace (7:35-8:13) should feel genuinely comfortable - you should be able to hold a full conversation. Don't let ego creep into easy runs. The goal is aerobic development and recovery, not proving toughness.

### Fueling and Hydration
- Practice fueling during long runs starting in Week 6
- Target 30-60g carbohydrates per hour on runs over 90 minutes
- Test different fuel sources (gels, chews, liquids) during training
- Never try anything new on race day
- Stay hydrated but don't over-drink

### Strength Training
With 3 running days, you have 4 rest days available. Consider adding:
- 1-2 strength sessions per week (focus on single-leg strength, core stability, glute activation)
- Schedule strength after easy runs or on full rest days
- Reduce strength volume during taper (Week 11-12)
- Prioritize running over lifting - if you're too sore to run well, skip the gym

### Listen to Your Body
This plan is aggressive given your current 15-25 mile base and only 3 training days. Watch for:
- Persistent soreness or pain (beyond normal training fatigue)
- Poor sleep or elevated resting heart rate
- Loss of motivation or declining performance
- Illness or excessive life stress

**If you're struggling**:
- Skip the second interval/threshold session and make it easy
- Reduce long run distance by 10-15%
- Take an extra rest day
- Insert an additional recovery week if needed

### Adjust as Needed
This plan assumes:
- You're healthy and injury-free
- Your life stress is manageable
- You can execute quality sessions properly

If circumstances change (injury, illness, work stress, family obligations), adjust accordingly. It's better to arrive at the start line 90% trained and 100% healthy than 100% trained and breaking down.

### About the 83-Minute Goal
An 83-minute half marathon (6:19/mile pace) is an ambitious target that requires:
- Strong aerobic fitness
- Good lactate threshold
- Mental toughness to sustain pace

If you're currently running 15-25 miles per week, this will be a significant step up in both volume and intensity. Recent race times (10K, 5K) can help validate whether this goal is realistic. A general rule of thumb:
- 10K time x 2.1 + 30-60 seconds = HM estimate
- Example: 40:00 10K suggests 1:24-1:25 HM

Be prepared to adjust your race day goal based on how training goes. The fitness will come - trust the process.

### Race Day Strategy
- Start conservatively - aim for 6:20-6:22 for the first 3 miles
- Settle into 6:19 pace for miles 4-10
- If you feel strong at mile 10, gradually increase effort
- Practice your race pace during workouts so it feels natural
- Have a Plan B if conditions are tough (heat, wind, hills)

**Good luck with your training!**
