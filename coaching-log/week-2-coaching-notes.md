# Week 2 Coaching Notes
**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Training Week:** January 24-30, 2026
**Phase:** Foundation with Quality (Week 2 of 12)

## Week Summary
- **Planned:** 28 miles (6x1k intervals, 9 mile easy + strides, 11.5 mile long run)
- **Actual:** 26.55 miles running (3 runs completed/modified)
- **Volume:** 94.8% of planned running volume
- **Overall Training Load:** 83.08 miles total activity (including cross-training)

## Athlete's Perspective
- **Overall feeling:** Good week, felt challenging at the start but still feeling strong by the end
- **Body status:** Achy but fine in general, ready to keep going - normal training fatigue
- **Recovery:** Sleep good, energy levels good
- **Motivation:** Happy and feeling on track with the plan
- **Cross-training:** Cycling to work as regular commute (appreciates the cross-training benefits), yoga for lower back care

## Session Analysis

### Session 1: 6x1k Intervals (January 26)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Planned:** 1.5 mile warm-up, 6x1k @ I pace (5:41-5:55), 400m jog recovery, 1 mile cool-down (7.5 miles total)
- **Actual:** 6.76 miles total, 6x1k @ 5:55-6:00 pace
- **Pacing:** Slightly outside target range (5-6 seconds slower per km) but very consistent across all reps
  - Interval splits: 5:56, 6:00, 5:55, 5:58, 5:56, 5:55 pace (per mile)
  - Excellent consistency - no blow-up on early reps, no major fade
- **Heart Rate:** 145 bpm average, peaked at 170 bpm on later intervals (appropriate effort)
- **Execution Quality:** Strong performance. Athlete noted feeling fatigued on interval 3, then rallied for 5 and 6 - this shows good pacing discipline and mental strength
- **Recovery:** Active recovery was harder than usual (athlete normally does static recovery), but adapted well and kept moving
- **Notes:** Solid interval session with intelligent pacing. The slight slowness vs target is acceptable given adaptation to active recovery and blustery conditions. The ability to finish strong after a mid-session wobble is exactly what we want to see.

### Session 2: Easy 9 Miles + Strides (January 29)
- **Status:** Modified (shortened)
- **Planned:** 9 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13) + 6 strides
- **Actual:** 5.98 miles @ 8:36 average pace with strides
- **Pacing:** Within easy zone - good discipline on pace despite shorter distance
  - Most laps: 8:47-8:58 pace (proper easy running)
  - Final lap with strides: 7:54 pace (appropriate pickup)
- **Heart Rate:** 141 bpm average reported, but athlete notes HR monitor likely malfunctioned (spiked to 178 on strides which didn't match perceived effort)
- **Reason for Modification:** Time constraints and grim weather (blustery wind)
- **Notes:** Cut 3 miles short but maintained appropriate easy pace. Athlete made sound decision to prioritize quality over forcing the full distance in poor conditions. HR data unreliable this session.

### Session 3: Long Run (January 30)
- **Status:** Completed and exceeded planned distance
- **Planned:** 11.5 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13)
- **Actual:** 13.82 miles @ 8:10 average pace
- **Pacing:** Right in the easy zone - textbook aerobic running
  - Lap splits ranged 7:50 to 10:18 (one anomaly lap 9), mostly 8:00-8:40 range
  - Very controlled progression, no early aggression
  - Handled 440ft elevation gain well
- **Heart Rate:** 134 bpm average (max 152) - perfect easy aerobic effort
- **Execution Quality:** Excellent. Started on "tired and heavy legs" which came to life. First 10 miles felt very relaxed, last few miles harder but could have kept going.
- **Distance Rationale:** Intentionally added ~2.3 miles to compensate for the 3 miles cut from Thursday's run
- **Notes:** Outstanding long run execution. Proper easy pace throughout, good HR control, smart pacing. The decision to extend the run to make up volume shows good commitment, though swapping mid-week easy miles for long run miles does increase overall stress slightly.

## Cross-Training Summary
- **Cycling:** 4 rides totaling 45.38 miles (3:32:20)
  - Regular bike commute to work - excellent low-impact aerobic complement
  - Provides active recovery while maintaining cardiovascular fitness
  - Good substitute for extra running volume without added impact stress
- **Yoga:** 1 session (60 minutes) - first yoga session
  - Targeted intervention for lower back pain that had been bothering athlete
  - Smart addition given increased training load
- **Walking:** 6 walks totaling 11.15 miles
  - Good general movement and recovery activity
- **Strength/General:** 1 workout session (10 minutes)

**Assessment:** Cross-training is well-balanced and complementary to running. The cycling serves dual purpose (transportation + aerobic work) without replacing planned runs. Yoga addition is proactive self-care. This mix supports rather than detracts from the running focus.

## Progress Assessment

**Status: ON TRACK**

Week 2 is successfully completed with strong execution quality. Here's why:

**Strengths:**
- Interval workout executed with excellent pacing discipline and consistency
- Long run showed strong aerobic fitness with proper easy pace and good HR control
- Body is adapting well - normal fatigue without concerning issues
- Recovery metrics (sleep, energy) are solid
- Smart adaptation to active recovery in intervals
- Good judgment on cutting Thursday run short rather than forcing it in poor conditions

**Areas of Note:**
- Total running volume slightly under plan (26.55 vs 28 miles) due to shortened mid-week run
- Compensated by extending long run, though this does shift stress pattern
- Interval paces 5-6 seconds per km outside target range, but acceptable given conditions and consistency

**Overall:** The athlete is handling the training load well, showing good fitness gains, and making intelligent real-time decisions. The slight modification to volume is not concerning given the overall quality of work and good recovery status. Progression is appropriate for this stage of the plan.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Feedback
- **Interval session:** Really solid work! The consistency across all 6 reps was excellent, and rallying after feeling tired on rep 3 shows good mental strength. Adapting to active recovery is smart - keep doing that.
- **Long run:** Textbook execution! Perfect easy pace, good HR control, and smart pacing throughout. This is exactly how long runs should feel.
- **Volume management:** Good judgment on cutting Thursday's run short rather than forcing it, though in future it's generally better to accept lower weekly volume rather than compensating by extending the long run.

### Plan Adjustments
No adjustments needed. The plan stands as written for Week 3.

### Focus for Week 3

**Primary Focus: Nail the Full Easy Run Volume**

Week 3 has a 10-mile easy run planned for Day 2. After cutting Week 2's mid-week run short, the key focus is executing the full 10 miles at proper easy pace (7:35-8:13).

**Specifically:**
1. **Protect the easy run:** Plan ahead for time and conditions to ensure you can complete the full distance
2. **Stay disciplined on pace:** Keep it genuinely easy and conversational - no heroes
3. **Trust the process:** These mid-week easy miles are crucial for building aerobic base without adding the cumulative fatigue of a longer long run

**Secondary Focus:**
- Continue smart adaptation to active recoveries in the threshold workout (4x1 mile planned)
- Maintain current recovery practices (sleep, yoga, smart cross-training)

### Week 3 Preview
- **Volume:** 30 miles (peak of foundation phase)
- **Key Session:** 4x1 mile @ Threshold pace (6:04-6:19) - one more rep than Week 1
- **Easy Run:** 10 miles - protect this and execute fully
- **Long Run:** 12.5 miles - another step up, but manageable given Week 2 performance

You're building well. Keep the easy runs easy, execute the quality sessions with the same discipline you showed this week, and you'll be perfectly positioned for the recovery week that follows.

## Notes for Next Session
- Monitor that lower back - good that yoga is being added proactively
- Check HR monitor strap/battery before next run to get reliable data
- Remember: easy miles on tired legs mid-week are different training stimulus than extending long runs - both have value but serve different purposes

---

**Coach's Summary:** Strong week with excellent execution quality. Athlete is adapting well to the training load, showing good fitness progression, and making intelligent decisions. On track for goals. Keep doing what you're doing, just make sure to protect that full mid-week easy run volume in Week 3.
