# Week 5 Coaching Notes
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Athlete:** Colin Eberhardt

## Week Summary
- **Planned:** 32 miles running (5x1mi intervals @ 5:41-5:55, 10mi easy, 13.5mi long)
- **Actual:** 27 miles running (5x1mi intervals, 6mi easy, 12.5mi long trail)
- **Volume:** 5 miles short of plan (84% completion)
- **Cross-Training:** 46 miles cycling (3 rides + 1 scheduled)

## Athlete's Perspective
- Overall feeling: "Hard work"
- Monday interval session was brutal due to 20mph headwind
- Generally fatigued this week - busy socially with a few nights out
- Bouncing back slower than normal but coping okay
- No injuries (key positive!)
- Plans restful weekend ahead
- Cycling is part of regular routine
- Missed the 10-mile midweek easy run due to being too busy

## Session Analysis

### Session 1: 5x1 mile intervals (Monday, Feb 17)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Pacing:** Mixed due to headwind/tailwind - 3 reps bang on (5:44, 5:48, 5:53), 2 reps slower due to headwind (6:41, 6:46)
- **Heart Rate:** Excellent effort - avg 152 bpm overall, intervals hit 155-167 bpm (proper VO₂max work)
- **Notes:** Athlete labeled as "threshold pace" but was correct interval session. 20mph headwind made pacing inconsistent but effort was spot on. Getting this done in these conditions is a win.

### Session 2: Easy 10 miles (Tuesday, Feb 18)
- **Status:** Modified - only 6 miles completed
- **Pacing:** 8:14/mile (just outside prescribed 7:35-8:13 range)
- **Heart Rate:** 140 bpm average
- **Notes:** Felt easy to athlete. Shortened due to busy week. Effort was appropriate.

### Session 3: Long Run 13.5 miles (Thursday, Feb 20)
- **Status:** Nearly completed - 12.5 miles done
- **Pacing:** 8:40/mile (slower than easy pace range)
- **Heart Rate:** 140 bpm average
- **Notes:** Trail run with 1020ft elevation gain. Pace appropriate for terrain. Felt good to athlete. Smart execution on hilly terrain.

## Cross-Training Summary
- 3 rides completed: 33.92 miles, 2:42:19, 1362ft elevation
- 1 additional ride scheduled (12 miles)
- Total weekly cycling: ~46 miles
- Role: Regular routine, complementing running well. Maintaining aerobic fitness while reducing impact load.
- Balance: Good - not replacing too many runs, supporting overall training.

## Progress Assessment
**Slightly Behind but Managing Well**

Volume is down 5 miles (84% completion), but athlete made smart decisions given the circumstances. Key workout completed in difficult conditions with appropriate effort. Easy runs were kept genuinely easy, which is excellent discipline. Fatigue is real and acknowledged - busy social week impacted recovery. No injuries is the critical positive. Cross-training volume is strong and complementary.

The shortfall is entirely on easy aerobic volume, which is the least critical element when managing fatigue. Athlete is listening to body and making sensible choices.

## Recommendations
1. **Use Weekend for Full Recovery:** Fatigue is building, social calendar has been busy. Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and rest. Need to arrive at Week 6 ready for harder work.

2. **Week 6 Key Workout Focus:** 3x2 miles at threshold (6:04-6:19) is important for building lactate threshold endurance. Make this the priority.

3. **Volume Flexibility:** Week 6 calls for 35 miles (11 easy, 14.5 long with 3 at steady). If still fatigued, okay to trim 1-2 miles from easy or long run, but try to get close if recovered.

4. **Maintain Easy Day Discipline:** Currently doing well with this. Keep easy runs genuinely easy (7:35-8:13 on flat, slower on trails/hills).

5. **Cross-Training Balance:** Current cycling routine is working well - continue as is.

## Focus for Next Week
1. **Rest and recover this weekend** - proper sleep, good nutrition, take it easy
2. **Nail the 3x2 mile threshold workout** - this is your week 6 priority

**Key Message:** Quality over quantity when managing fatigue. Better to arrive healthy and ready than ground down and struggling.
