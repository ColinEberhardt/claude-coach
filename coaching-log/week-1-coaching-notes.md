# Week 1 Coaching Notes
**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Training Week:** January 17-23, 2026

## Week Summary
- **Planned:** 3 sessions totaling 24.5 miles (Threshold workout, 8 miles easy + strides, 10 miles easy)
- **Actual:** 22.4 miles running across 6 activities (plus 43 miles cycling, 18.7 miles walking)
- **Volume:** 22.4 miles (planned: 24.5 miles) - 91% completion

## Athlete's Perspective
- Overall feeling: "Felt good for week 1"
- Energy: Not too tired, but not full of energy - somewhere in the middle
- Sleep: Good
- Energy levels: Good
- Mood: Excited about the training plan
- Standout workout: 8x1k session - pleased to hold pace across 8 reps
- Body feeling: Good, a bit tired
- Cross-training: Cycling to work (43 miles) - using as cross-training complement

## Session Analysis

### Session 1: 8x1km Interval Workout (January 19)
- **Status:** Completed (NOT on plan - this was a Week 2+ workout)
- **Distance:** 5.51 miles total
- **Interval Paces:** 6:01, 6:03, 5:58, 5:58, 5:58, 5:59, 5:59, 5:51 /mile
- **Heart Rate:** 150 avg, 172 max
- **Analysis:** Excellent execution - very consistent pacing across all 8 reps. Proper VO2max intensity (HR 150-172). Recovery periods allowed adequate HR drop. However, this workout was harder than prescribed (6x1k scheduled for Week 2) and not on Week 1 plan.
- **Notes:** Athlete wanted to "test himself, start hard" - completed 8 reps instead of the scheduled threshold work.

### Session 2: 3x1 Mile Threshold (January 21)
- **Status:** Completed (actual Week 1 prescribed workout)
- **Distance:** 4.12 miles total
- **Mile Splits:** 6:06, 6:22, 6:36 /mile (target: 6:04-6:19)
- **Heart Rate:** 148 avg, 172 max
- **Pacing Analysis:** First mile right on target at 6:06. Significant fade of 15-16 seconds per mile across reps (6:06 → 6:22 → 6:36). Elevation contributed (230ft total), but fade pattern suggests carrying fatigue from 8x1k session 2 days prior.
- **Notes:** Threshold work should feel comfortably hard with sustainable, even splits. The drop-off indicates working on tired legs. Done only 2 days after hard interval session.

### Session 3: 10 Mile Long Run (January 23)
- **Status:** Modified - planned 3 miles at HM pace, abandoned due to wind
- **Distance:** 10.01 miles
- **Average Pace:** 7:48 /mile (Easy pace range: 7:35-8:13)
- **Heart Rate:** 131 avg, 152 max
- **Pacing Analysis:** Highly variable due to wind - tailwind early miles (7:36-7:37), slower middle section (8:06-8:18), attempted HM pace miles 8-9 (6:38, 6:59) into headwind, then recovery (8:37).
- **Notes:** Smart decision to abandon HM pace work due to strong wind. HR averaging 131 is good for easy running. Overall pace at faster end of easy range. Conditions made consistent pacing impossible - appropriate to adapt.

### Additional Runs
- **January 19:** 0.66 mi @ 7:55 pace, 0.43 mi @ 9:14 pace
- **January 20:** 1.67 mi @ 9:35 pace
- **Notes:** Warm-ups and cool-downs logged separately

## Cross-Training Summary
- **Cycling:** 43 miles across 4 rides (commuting to work)
- **Role:** Aerobic conditioning without impact stress - smart complementary training
- **Walking:** 18.7 miles (likely daily life/recovery)
- **Balance:** Good - cross-training supports running without replacing it

## Progress Assessment
**Ahead of Target - But With Concerns**

The athlete is clearly fit and capable of executing quality work. Both interval and threshold sessions showed strong fitness:
- 8x1k intervals: textbook consistency and pacing
- Threshold work: hit target pace on first mile
- Long run: appropriate easy HR despite variable conditions

However, Week 1 included 150% of prescribed quality work:
1. Completed 8x1k interval session (not scheduled until Week 2+)
2. Also completed 3x1 mile threshold (actual Week 1 workout)

This doubled the hard running load for the opening week.

**Red Flags:**
- Feeling "okay, not too tired, but not full of energy" in Week 1 - should feel more peppy
- Threshold fade pattern (6:06 → 6:36) suggests cumulative fatigue
- Adding extra quality sessions this early risks burnout in Weeks 6-10

The athlete is clearly motivated and wants to prove fitness, which is excellent. But this is a 12-week build - success requires pacing the training stimulus, not front-loading it.

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Celebrate the wins:** Both quality sessions showed strong execution and fitness
2. **Acknowledge the enthusiasm:** The desire to test yourself is great, but needs channeling appropriately

### Going Forward
1. **Stick to ONE quality session per week** - the plan prescribes one hard workout per week for a reason. With 4 rest days available, use them for cycling, strength work, or actual rest - not bonus running workouts.

2. **Trust the plan's progression** - Week 1 starts conservative deliberately. The intensity and volume build significantly:
   - Week 2: 6x1k intervals
   - Week 3: 4x1 mile threshold
   - Week 7: 16.5 mile long run + 3x2mi @ HM pace
   - Week 10: 19 miles with 10 miles steady pace

3. **Respect easy pace (7:35-8:13)** - Long run averaged 7:48, which is faster end of easy. Truly easy running should allow comfortable conversation. Save speed for prescribed workouts.

4. **Monitor energy levels** - Currently feeling "okay" is acceptable but not ideal. Should feel eager and energetic this early. If Week 2 brings genuine fatigue, consider backing off.

5. **Make smart adaptations** - Decision to abandon HM pace work due to wind was correct. Continue showing this judgment.

### Plan Adjustments
**No changes to plan.** Continue with prescribed Week 2 schedule:
- 6x1km @ interval pace (5:41-5:55)
- 9 miles easy + strides
- 11.5 mile long run
- **Total: 28 miles**

Do JUST this - no extra intervals, no bonus threshold work. Execute the prescribed workouts well with proper easy running.

## Focus for Week 2
**ONE THING:** Stick to the plan as written. No extra quality work.

Execute the 6x1k workout well, cruise genuinely easy on the 9-miler and long run, and finish the week feeling strong and eager for Week 3.

You're fit. You're motivated. Now let's channel that into 12 weeks of smart, progressive training that gets you to the start line ready to crush that 1:23 goal - not limping there because you cooked yourself in January.

See you next week!
