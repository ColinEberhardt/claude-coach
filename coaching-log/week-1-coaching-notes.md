# Week 1 Coaching Notes
**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Athlete:** Colin Eberhardt
**Training Phase:** Foundation with Quality (Week 1 of 12)

## Week Summary
- **Planned:** 24.5 miles (Threshold workout, Easy 8 miles, Long run 10 miles)
- **Actual:** 22.39 miles running (6 activities)
- **Volume:** 22.39 miles (92% of planned)
- **Cross-Training:** 43 miles cycling, 19 miles walking, 1 strength workout

## Athlete's Perspective
- Overall feel: Generally very good, pleased with 8x1k session
- Later sessions challenging due to high winds
- Felt ready for intervals, jumped to Week 2 workout
- Recovery: Normal fatigue, ready for Week 2

## Session Analysis

### Session 1: 8 x 1km Intervals (Jan 19)
- **Status:** Completed (Week 2 workout done early)
- **Prescribed:** Week 2's 6 x 1km @ I pace (5:41-5:55/mile)
- **Actual:** 8 x 1km @ 5:58-6:03/mile pace
- **Pacing:** Slightly slower than target but did 8 reps instead of 6. Excellent consistency (5-second variance across all reps)
- **Heart Rate:** 150-162 bpm on intervals, good recovery between reps
- **Notes:** Strong execution. Athlete felt "happy with that." Shows good fitness and readiness. Consistency more important than hitting fastest target pace.

### Session 2: 3-Mile Threshold Run (Jan 21)
- **Status:** Completed (modified structure)
- **Prescribed:** 3 x 1 mile @ T pace (6:04-6:19) with 0.25 mile jog recovery
- **Actual:** 3 x 1 mile @ 6:06, 6:22, 6:36
- **Pacing:** First rep perfect, faded 30 seconds from rep 1 to rep 3. Drifted outside target zone.
- **Heart Rate:** 151, 162, 165 bpm - increasing effort across reps
- **Terrain:** Hilly (230 ft elevation in 4.12 miles)
- **Notes:** Good start, poor finish. Suggests either aggressive first rep, insufficient recovery, or cumulative fatigue from intervals 2 days prior. Need better pacing discipline.

### Session 3: 10-Mile Long Run (Jan 23)
- **Status:** Completed with smart modification
- **Prescribed:** 10 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13)
- **Actual:** 10 miles @ 7:48/mile average, attempted HM pace work but bailed due to wind
- **Pacing:** Excellent - most miles 7:36-8:18 (within easy zone). Laps 8-9 briefly at 6:38, 6:59 before stopping HM pace attempt.
- **Heart Rate:** 122-136 bpm for easy miles (appropriate), 142 bpm when pushing harder
- **Notes:** Perfect execution. Smart decision to abandon quality work in windy conditions. This is exactly what long runs should feel like.

### Missing: Easy 8-Mile Run
- **Status:** Not completed
- **Prescribed:** Day 2 - Easy 8 miles @ E pace + 6 strides
- **Actual:** Several short runs (1.67 mi, 0.43 mi, 0.66 mi) but no continuous easy 8 miles
- **Notes:** This is the main gap in the week. Foundation miles matter.

## Cross-Training Notes
- 4 bike rides totaling 43 miles (HR 128-133 bpm avg) - moderate intensity
- 6 walks totaling 19 miles (HR 67-107 bpm) - excellent active recovery
- 1 strength/workout session (12 minutes)
- Total training load is high - monitor for cumulative fatigue

## Progress Assessment
**Status:** ON TRACK ✓

**Positive Indicators:**
- Executing quality sessions well
- 8x1k intervals showed strong fitness and consistency
- Long run pacing was disciplined and appropriate
- Smart adjustments for conditions (wind)
- Heart rate patterns healthy, no overtraining signs
- Strong motivation and confidence
- Recovery feels normal

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Threshold workout execution - need better pacing discipline
- Swapped Week 1/Week 2 workouts - respect plan progression
- Missing easy 8-miler reduces volume slightly
- Cross-training volume is high - ensure it supports rather than compromises running

**Overall:** Athlete is fit, motivated, and executing well. The fitness is clearly there - handled 8 intervals strongly. Main focus should be on pacing discipline, following plan sequence, and not skipping foundation miles.

## Recommendations

1. **Respect Plan Progression**
   - Stick to prescribed workouts week-by-week
   - Plan is sequenced intentionally: threshold first, then intervals
   - Jumping ahead may compromise adaptation

2. **Nail Threshold Pacing**
   - Start conservatively (6:12-6:15, not 6:06)
   - Focus on even pacing or negative splitting
   - Should be "comfortably hard" and sustainable
   - If fading >10 seconds per rep, started too fast

3. **Complete Foundation Miles**
   - Week 2 calls for easy 9 miles - don't skip it
   - Easy runs build aerobic base for half marathon
   - Target 7:35-8:13/mile, truly conversational
   - Add 6 strides at the end

4. **Manage Cross-Training Load**
   - Current volume is high but sustainable if feeling fresh
   - Ensure cycling is easy/moderate, not hard efforts
   - If legs feel tired before key workouts, reduce cross-training intensity

5. **Week 2 Adjustment**
   - **Recommended:** Do Week 1's threshold workout (3 x 1 mile @ T pace) with better execution
   - Alternative: Proceed with Week 2 but modify the interval day since already completed
   - Complete easy 9 miles + strides
   - Long run 11.5 miles easy

## Focus for Next Week

- **Pace discipline on threshold work** - start conservative, finish strong
- **Complete the easy 9-miler** - no skipping foundation miles
- **Trust the plan sequence** - resist urge to jump ahead
- **Continue smart adjustments** - weather, conditions, how you feel
- **Keep executing intervals well** - consistency was excellent

## Coach's Notes

Strong start to the training block. Athlete has the fitness and motivation to hit the 1:23:00 half marathon goal. Main coaching points:

1. Channel eagerness productively - follow the plan rather than jumping ahead
2. Threshold pacing needs work - this is crucial for race-specific fitness
3. Foundation miles matter - don't let cross-training replace continuous easy running
4. Smart decision-making on display (bailing on HM pace in wind) - keep that up

Confidence level in goal: High. Fitness is there, just needs to refine execution and trust the progressive build.
