# Week 3 Coaching Notes (FINAL)
**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Athlete:** Colin Eberhardt

## Week Summary
- **Planned:** Threshold (4x1mi), 2 easy recovery runs (12mi + 8mi), Parkrun 5K race
- **Actual:** Threshold (4x1mi), 2 easy recovery runs (11.4mi + 7.9mi), Parkrun missed
- **Volume:** 26.6 miles (planned: 27.5 miles before parkrun, 33.5-34.5 with parkrun)

## Athlete's Perspective
- **Overall feeling:** Good, felt solid throughout the week
- **Threshold session:** Felt pretty solid despite wind, last rep didn't feel hard at all - could have pushed faster
- **Recovery runs:** Felt good, a bit tired after threshold (as expected) but managed well
- **Physical status:** Some back stiffness noted, but not directly connected to running. Athlete doing yoga and stretches, monitoring situation
- **Parkrun:** Unable to attend - resulted in 4-day rest period (Wed-Sat)
- **Recovery status:** Reports feeling fully recovered, watch indicates complete recovery

## Session Analysis

### Session 1: Threshold - 4 x 1 mile (Sunday, Feb 2)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Distance:** 7.25 miles (planned: 7.5 miles)
- **Workout:** 4 x 1 mile @ T pace with 0.25 mile jog recovery
- **Pacing:** 6:09/mile average (range: 6:06-6:12)
  - Target: 6:04-6:19/mile (Threshold)
  - Result: Perfect execution - right in the middle of the zone
  - Consistency: Excellent (6-second spread across 4 reps)
- **Heart Rate:** 144 bpm avg (max: 172 bpm)
  - Progression: 148 → 167 → 168 → 166 bpm across intervals
  - Good effort management despite windy conditions
- **Notes:** Athlete felt strong, particularly on final rep. Wind affected effort but pacing remained consistent. Strong indicator of adaptation to training. "Could have pushed faster" on last rep suggests good fitness gains.

### Session 2: Recovery Run 1 (Monday, Feb 3)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Distance:** 11.4 miles (planned: 12 miles)
- **Pacing:** 9:08/mile average
  - Target: ~9:00/mile (recovery pace)
  - Result: Spot on! Textbook recovery effort
  - Consistency: Very tight range (8:49-9:39/mi)
- **Heart Rate:** 123 bpm avg (max: 147 bpm)
  - Excellent recovery effort - properly easy
  - Very consistent throughout
- **Notes:** Day after threshold work, felt good but appropriately tired. Perfect execution of recovery pace discipline.

### Session 3: Recovery Run 2 (Tuesday, Feb 4)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Distance:** 7.9 miles (planned: 8 miles)
- **Pacing:** 8:58/mile average
  - Target: ~9:00/mile (recovery pace)
  - Result: Perfect - hit the prescribed pace exactly
- **Heart Rate:** 121 bpm avg (max: 148 bpm)
  - Started a bit elevated (first 2 miles: 135-142 bpm)
  - Settled beautifully into recovery effort for remaining miles (111-118 bpm)
- **Notes:** Caught himself after starting slightly quick and adjusted well. Demonstrates good awareness and discipline.

### Session 4: Parkrun 5K Race (Saturday, Feb 8)
- **Status:** Missed - unable to attend
- **Impact:** Resulted in 4-day rest period (Wed-Sat), creating unintentional recovery period

## Cross-Training Summary
None reported this week. Focus was entirely on running sessions.

## Progress Assessment

**Overall: Excellent Progress (with Smart Adjustment Ahead)**

Colin is executing the training plan with impressive precision. Key highlights:

**Strengths:**
1. **Pacing Discipline:** Consistently hitting prescribed paces across all workout types
   - Threshold: 6:09 average vs 6:04-6:19 range ✓
   - Recovery: 9:08 and 8:58 vs ~9:00 target ✓
2. **Execution Quality:** 4x1 mile threshold reps showed only 6-second variance (6:06-6:12)
3. **Effort Management:** HR data shows appropriate effort levels for workout types
4. **Self-Awareness:** Caught himself starting too quick on Tuesday run and adjusted
5. **Adaptation:** Final threshold rep felt easy, suggesting good fitness gains

**Areas of Note:**
1. Back stiffness being proactively managed with yoga/stretching - good approach
2. Parkrun missed - lost race stimulus but gained significant recovery time
3. Volume: 26.6 miles actual vs 27.5 base plan (before parkrun adjustment)

**Fitness Indicators:**
- Threshold work feeling stronger (last rep "didn't feel hard at all")
- Consistent pacing across varied conditions (wind)
- Recovery runs appropriately easy with low HR (121-123 bpm)
- Body responding well to training stress
- Athlete reports feeling fully recovered after 4-day rest

## Recommendations & Week 4 Adjustment

### Context for Adjustment
The missed parkrun created an unintentional recovery scenario:
- Only 26.6 miles completed this week (below planned volume)
- 4-day complete rest period (Wed-Sat)
- Athlete reports feeling fully recovered
- Watch metrics confirm complete recovery

**Athlete's observation:** "This feels like a recovery week already"

**Coaching decision:** Agreed. Standard Week 4 recovery week (24 miles) would likely leave athlete feeling flat rather than sharp. Smart, responsive training means adjusting based on actual status, not blindly following the plan.

### Modified Week 4 Plan (Starting Feb 9, 2026)

**Changed from:** Recovery Week (24 miles)
**Changed to:** Modified Build Week (28.5 miles)

**Workouts:**
- **Day 1 (Tue/Wed):** Tempo - 1.5 mi warm-up, **5 miles @ T pace** (6:04-6:19), 1 mi cool-down (7.5 miles total)
- **Day 2 (Thu/Fri):** Easy **9 miles** @ E pace (7:35-8:13) + 6 strides
- **Day 3 (Sat/Sun):** Long Run - **12 miles** easy @ E pace
- **Total: 28.5 miles** (vs original 24 miles)

**Rationale:**
- 5-mile continuous tempo builds threshold durability (next progression from 4x1 mile)
- Volume increase is conservative (+4.5 miles from original recovery week)
- Coming off complete rest, body is ready for training stimulus
- Athlete has demonstrated excellent ability to execute threshold pace
- This bridges appropriately to Week 5 build phase

**Important Cautions:**
- Listen to body throughout the week
- If tempo feels unexpectedly hard, back off immediately
- If fatigue appears on easy runs, reduce volume
- This is adjusted based on CURRENT recovery status, but week-to-week adaptation still matters
- Keep easy runs EASY (7:35-8:13) to absorb the increased volume

### Ongoing Monitoring
1. **Back stiffness:** Continue yoga/stretches. Report any worsening or gait changes.
2. **Recovery quality:** Monitor sleep, resting HR, general energy
3. **Workout execution:** Tempo should feel comfortably hard, not desperate

## Focus for Week 4

**Primary Focus:**
1. **5-mile tempo block:** Longest continuous threshold effort so far
   - Pace target: Aim for middle of zone (6:10-6:15/mile) for safety
   - Should feel comfortably hard and sustainable, not desperate
   - Different stimulus from interval work - builds mental and physical durability

**Secondary Focus:**
2. **Volume management:** 28.5 miles is a jump from this week's 26.6
   - Easy runs must be EASY (7:35-8:13/mile)
   - This is where volume gets absorbed
   - Don't let ego creep into these runs

**Ongoing:**
3. **Back stiffness monitoring:** Continue proactive management
   - Yoga and stretching working so far
   - Report any changes in symptoms
   - Stop immediately if it affects running mechanics

## Key Takeaway

Colin is adapting very well to the training and showing excellent discipline in execution. The decision to modify Week 4 based on actual recovery status (rather than blindly following the original plan) demonstrates smart, responsive training. This is exactly how good training works - you follow the plan when conditions match expectations, and adjust intelligently when they don't.

**What went right this week:**
- Threshold execution was nearly perfect
- Recovery pace discipline was exemplary
- Self-awareness and body monitoring are strong
- Proactive approach to minor niggles (back stiffness)

**The plan adjustment:**
- Based on objective reality (4 days rest, full recovery, below-target volume)
- Conservative increase (28.5 vs 24 miles, not jumping to full Week 5 load)
- Appropriate progression (continuous tempo vs interval work)
- Built-in safety valves (listen to body, back off if needed)

**For Week 4:** Execute that 5-mile tempo with confidence, keep the easy runs genuinely easy, and enjoy the 12-miler. You've earned the right to bump up the volume, and your body is ready for it.

**Red flags to watch:**
- Back stiffness progression
- Persistent soreness beyond normal training fatigue
- Unexpected fatigue during workouts
- Poor sleep or elevated resting heart rate

**Otherwise:** Keep doing exactly what you're doing. The pacing precision, effort management, and recovery discipline are all spot on. This is quality training.
