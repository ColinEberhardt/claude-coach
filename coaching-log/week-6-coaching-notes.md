# Week 6 Coaching Notes
**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Week:** February 23-28, 2026

## Week Summary
- **Planned:** 35 miles (3 x 2mi threshold, 11mi easy + strides, 14.5mi long run with 3mi steady finish)
- **Actual:** ~21 run miles + ~60 bike miles
- **Volume:** 21 miles running (planned: 35 miles) - 60% of plan

## Athlete's Perspective
- Fell ill early in week with cough and sore throat
- Attempted run on Feb 23 but wisely bailed after 1.6 miles when throat/head weren't cooperating
- Recovered gradually throughout week
- Trail run on Feb 26 was a "tester" - felt harder than usual with elevated HR, confirming rest was needed
- Long run on Feb 27 felt good, executed steady finish as planned
- Almost completely recovered by week's end, still slight cough but energy back
- Maintained fitness with 60 miles cycling despite illness
- Feeling ready for March 8 trail race

## Session Analysis

### Session 1: Feb 23 - Abandoned Run
- **Planned:** Threshold - 3 x 2 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19) - 9.5 miles total
- **Actual:** 1.6 miles @ 9:31/mile - STOPPED
- **Status:** Correctly abandoned due to illness
- **HR:** 125 avg (appropriate for very easy pace)
- **Notes:** Excellent decision-making. When sick with respiratory issues, stopping was 100% the right call. Better to lose one workout than wreck the whole week or worse.

### Session 2: Feb 26 - Trail Run "Tester"
- **Planned:** Easy 11 miles @ E pace (7:35-8:13) + 6 strides
- **Actual:** 5.8 miles trail @ 8:33/mile
- **Status:** Modified - used as fitness test
- **Pacing:** Appropriate easy effort given context
- **HR:** 145 avg (elevated for this effort - indicator still recovering)
- **Notes:** Smart use of this run as a litmus test. Athlete noted HR was higher than usual for the effort, confirming body still fighting illness. Reduced volume appropriate. No strides attempted - sensible.

### Session 3: Feb 27 - Long Run with Steady Finish
- **Planned:** 14.5 miles, last 3 @ steady pace (6:57-7:16)
- **Actual:** 13.8 miles, last 2 @ steady pace (7:12, 6:57)
- **Status:** Completed - excellent execution!
- **Pacing Analysis:**
  - Miles 1-11: 7:44-8:21/mile (proper easy running, especially post-illness)
  - Mile 12: 7:12/mile (right at steady pace target)
  - Mile 13: 6:57/mile (bang on faster end of steady pace)
- **HR:** 147 avg overall, pushed to 159 for final mile (appropriate progression)
- **Power:** Steady 268-287W for easy miles, jumped to 317-331W for steady finish
- **Notes:** Really well-executed workout. Kept it controlled for the bulk, then proper steady finish. This confirmed athlete was recovering well. Only 0.7 miles short of target distance - basically nailed it.

## Cross-Training Summary
- Maintained ~60 miles cycling throughout the week despite illness
- Smart decision - kept aerobic fitness ticking over without stressing respiratory system
- Cycling much more forgiving than running when dealing with throat/cough issues
- Demonstrates good training maturity and understanding of when to substitute

## Progress Assessment
**Context-appropriate execution**

This week was effectively an unplanned recovery/illness week rather than the scheduled build week. However, athlete showed excellent decision-making throughout:

**Strengths:**
- Outstanding self-awareness and adaptability
- Correctly identified when to stop/rest (Feb 23)
- Smart use of trial run to test recovery status (Feb 26)
- Strong execution when ready (Feb 27 long run)
- Maintained aerobic stimulus via cycling without compromising recovery
- No hero mentality - listened to body

**Considerations:**
- Missed key threshold session (3 x 2 miles) - will need to address in Week 7
- Volume significantly reduced (21 vs 35 miles)
- Elevated HR on Feb 26 indicated still recovering at that point
- Slight cough still lingering at week's end

**Overall:** Given the circumstances, this week was handled perfectly. Better to have one illness-modified week than push through and create a bigger problem. The long run execution shows fitness is still there.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Feedback
✅ **Excellent decisions throughout** - knowing when to bail, when to test, when to execute
✅ **Long run was spot on** - that steady finish showed you're ready to work again
✅ **Smart cross-training** - keeping the bike going was the right move
⚠️ **Monitor recovery** - still have slight cough, HR should be back to normal now

### Week 7 Plan Adjustments

**Original Week 7 (Race Week):**
- 8-9 miles easy (Sun/Mon)
- 7.5 miles with 2 x 2mi threshold (Tue)
- 5-6 miles easy (Thu)
- 4 miles shakeout (Fri)
- 12K trail race (Sat)
- Total: 36-39 miles

**Modified Week 7 (Post-Illness Race Week):**
- **Sun/Mon (Mar 2/3):** SKIP or very light 3-4 miles if feeling restless
- **Tuesday (Mar 4):** Threshold - 2 x 2 miles @ T pace (6:04-6:19) - FULL WORKOUT - Use as fitness test
- **Thursday (Mar 6):** Easy 5-6 miles, conversational pace
- **Friday (Mar 7):** Shakeout 4 miles easy + 4-6 strides
- **Saturday (Mar 8):** 12K TRAIL RACE - race hard IF Tuesday goes well
- **Total: 25-28 miles**

**Rationale:**
- Skipping/reducing Sun/Mon gives extra recovery time before key threshold session
- Tuesday's threshold workout becomes the "green light" test - if HR is normal and paces feel good, cleared to race hard Saturday
- If Tuesday feels rough, adjust race expectations to "controlled effort" rather than all-out
- Reduced weekly volume more appropriate given illness week

### Racing Strategy for March 8
**IF Tuesday threshold goes well:**
- Race the 12K hard - full effort
- This will provide excellent training stimulus
- Trail racing = great neuromuscular and economy work

**IF Tuesday feels off:**
- Still do the race but treat it as a "solid effort" not all-out
- Use it as quality training, not a test
- Better to arrive at race day fresh than fried

### What to Look for Tuesday (Fitness Test Indicators)
✅ HR normal for threshold effort (160s-170s range)
✅ Can hit 6:04-6:19 pace without dying
✅ Recovery between 2-mile reps feels manageable
✅ Don't feel absolutely wrecked afterward

If all these check out → GREEN LIGHT for Saturday

## Focus for Week 7
1. **Don't rush back** - Skip/reduce that Sunday/Monday run
2. **Tuesday is your barometer** - Use threshold session to confirm you're truly ready
3. **Stay fresh** - Keep Thu/Fri easy and short
4. **Race smart** - Let Tuesday's session dictate Saturday's effort level

## Looking Ahead
- Week 8 is a recovery week (perfect timing after race)
- Week 9 starts the specific phase with HM pace work
- Missing Week 6's threshold work isn't ideal, but one missed session won't derail the plan
- The illness-forced rest might actually set you up well for the harder weeks ahead

**Bottom line:** You handled a tough week brilliantly. Now trust the process, use Tuesday as your test, and if you're cleared - go race that 12K hard!
