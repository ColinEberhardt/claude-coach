## Guide to Designing Training Plans for 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and Marathon

This guide is written as a “plan-construction framework” you can apply to athletes across ability levels. It covers (1) the overall shape of an effective plan, (2) the training paces / intensities you’ll use, and (3) high-level example structures for common plan lengths and race distances—without prescribing a single fixed plan.

## 1) Core Principles That Drive Plan Design

### Specificity

Training should increasingly resemble the event’s demands as race day approaches:

* **5K:** high aerobic power, speed-endurance, economy; limited but meaningful long-run focus.
* **10K:** strong aerobic base + sustained threshold; moderate long run; some speed.
* **Half:** threshold durability + aerobic volume; long runs with steady/MP-like segments; fueling practice begins.
* **Marathon:** aerobic volume, long-run specificity, marathon pace durability, fueling and fatigue resistance; cautious intensity management.

### Progressive overload with deliberate recovery

* Build stress gradually via **volume**, **frequency**, **density** (less recovery between quality), and **specific intensity**.
* Avoid increasing too many variables at once.
* Recovery is planned, not reactive: most athletes thrive on **3:1** (three build weeks, one down week) or **2:1** patterns.

### Consistency beats hero sessions

A plan should maximize “repeatability.” The best session is the one the athlete can execute well and return from.

### Individualization constraints (the practical reality)

A good plan is not “optimal in theory”; it is **viable**:

* Available days, injury history, training age, lifestyle load, terrain/weather access.
* Strength training tolerance and total stress budget.
* Ability to handle intensity (many athletes need fewer hard sessions than they want).

### Polarization and distribution (simple coaching heuristic)

For most endurance athletes: the bulk is **easy**, with a smaller but meaningful dose of **moderate-hard** work.

* Many athletes do best with ~**80–90% easy** and **10–20% quality**, but the exact distribution depends on experience, event, and time available.

## 2) The “Shape” of a Good Plan: Phases and Purposes

Nearly all effective plans can be viewed as moving through these phases. The durations vary by race distance and athlete background.

### Phase A — Foundation / Base (Aerobic + musculoskeletal readiness)

**Purpose**

* Build frequency and easy volume
* Improve aerobic efficiency and durability
* Develop tissue capacity for later intensity (tendons, bones, connective tissue)
* Establish strength/mobility habits

**Typical ingredients**

* Easy running, strides, short hill sprints (neuromuscular)
* Light-to-moderate long run
* Strength training 1–2x/week (general + running-specific)
* Optional gentle fartlek for athletes who need variety

**Key outputs**

* Athlete can handle consistent weekly mileage and recover well.
* Minor niggles are controlled; training is repeatable.

---

### Phase B — Build / Development (Introduce and expand “quality”)

**Purpose**

* Increase aerobic power (VO₂max development for shorter events)
* Raise lactate threshold / critical speed
* Improve running economy and efficiency
* Maintain or continue gradual volume growth

**Typical ingredients**

* One to two quality sessions per week (depending on athlete)
* Long run continues (more important as distance increases)
* Medium-long run (esp. 10K+)
* Continued strides/hills

**Key outputs**

* Improved ability to sustain faster paces with controlled effort.
* Athlete adapts to structured workouts without excessive fatigue.

---

### Phase C — Specific / Peak (Race-specific endurance and sharpening)

**Purpose**

* Target the key physiological demands of the event
* Develop pace durability (especially HM/Marathon)
* Convert fitness into race-ready specificity
* Reduce non-essential stress (manage fatigue)

**Typical ingredients**

* Race-pace work becomes more prominent
* Volume peaks (especially marathon) then stabilizes
* Workouts become more specific; less “random fitness”

**Key outputs**

* Athlete demonstrates race-pace control and durability.
* Fueling/hydration and logistics are practiced (HM/Marathon, sometimes 10K).

---

### Phase D — Taper / Freshen (Maintain sharpness, reduce fatigue)

**Purpose**

* Shed accumulated fatigue while preserving neuromuscular sharpness
* Maintain frequency; reduce volume; keep small intensity doses

**Typical pattern**

* **Reduce volume** while keeping some short race-pace / threshold touches.
* Avoid “last-minute fitness” attempts.
* Marathon taper is typically longer than 5K/10K taper.

**Key outputs**

* Athlete arrives fresh, confident, and primed.

---

### Phase E — Transition (Post-race recovery and reset)

**Purpose**

* Physical and mental recovery
* Reflection and recalibration
* Rebuild routine gently before the next block

**Typical ingredients**

* Several easy days to weeks depending on event/effort
* Return to structured training gradually

---

## 3) Training Intensities and Paces (What Your Plans Contain)

You can describe intensities in pace terms, physiological terms, or RPE. Most coaches blend all three.

### Easy / Recovery (E)

**Purpose:** aerobic development, recovery, volume support
**Feel:** conversational; relaxed; RPE ~2–4/10
**Use:** the majority of weekly mileage; between quality sessions

### Long Run (LR)

Often mostly easy, sometimes with controlled segments depending on phase and event.

* **Purpose:** durability, glycogen management, musculoskeletal resilience
* **For marathon/HM:** key specificity lever (with segments at steady/MP)

### Steady / Aerobic Endurance (S)

“Comfortably steady,” harder than easy but controlled.

* **Purpose:** aerobic strength, fatigue resistance
* **Feel:** controlled; RPE ~4–5/10
* **Use:** marathon/HM benefit most; use carefully with newer athletes (it can become “moderately hard all the time,” a common error).

### Threshold / Tempo (T)

Sustained “comfortably hard” work (classic lactate threshold zone).

* **Purpose:** raise sustainable speed; improve clearance and tolerance
* **Feel:** controlled discomfort; RPE ~6–7/10; speaking in short phrases
* **Formats:** continuous tempo (20–40 min), cruise intervals (e.g., 4–8 x 5 min), “broken tempo”

### VO₂max / Interval (I)

Hard repetitions with meaningful recovery.

* **Purpose:** aerobic power, speed endurance, economy under stress
* **Feel:** hard but repeatable; RPE ~8–9/10
* **Formats:** 3–6 min reps; hill reps; track intervals

### Repetition / Speed (R)

Short, fast reps with generous recovery.

* **Purpose:** neuromuscular power, form, economy, speed reserve
* **Feel:** fast, crisp; not a grind
* **Formats:** 100–400 m, hill sprints, strides

### Race Pace (RP)

Specific pace rehearsal for pacing, rhythm, mental familiarity.

* **5K/10K RP:** often in intervals/sets (e.g., 1K repeats).
* **HM RP:** longer repeats or steady segments.
* **Marathon Pace (MP):** extensive work in long runs and medium-long runs; must be managed carefully to avoid excessive fatigue.

### “Strides”

Short accelerations (10–25 sec) with full recovery.

* **Purpose:** mechanics, turnover, economy
* **Placement:** after easy runs 1–3x/week

## 4) The Weekly “Architecture”: How to Assemble a Microcycle

A typical week balances:

1. **Key session 1:** threshold or VO₂max depending on event/phase
2. **Key session 2 (optional for some athletes):** race-pace / tempo / hills
3. **Long run**
4. **Everything else easy** (plus strides)

### Frequency of hard sessions (rule of thumb)

* **Novice / injury-prone:** 1 quality + long run (long run easy) is often enough.
* **Intermediate:** 2 quality days most weeks + long run.
* **Advanced:** 2 quality + long run that may include quality segments; occasionally 3 “stimulus days” if the athlete is robust (but keep true intensity limited).

### Common weekly templates (examples)

**Template A (3–4 days/week runner)**

* Tue: quality (threshold or intervals)
* Thu/Sat: easy + strides
* Sun: long run (mostly easy)
* Optional: 1 strength day

**Template B (5–6 days/week runner)**

* Tue: quality (threshold)
* Thu: quality (intervals or hills)
* Sun: long run (easy or with segments depending on phase)
* 2–3 easy runs, one as medium-long for HM/Marathon

**Template C (marathon-specific mid/high volume)**

* Tue: threshold / sub-threshold
* Thu: marathon pace / steady
* Sun: long run with MP blocks or progression
* Medium-long midweek
* Easy running fills the gaps

---

## 5) Progression Models (How a Plan Evolves Week to Week)

### Volume progression

* Increase weekly volume gradually; many coaches cap weekly increases around **5–10%**, but use judgment.
* Add **days** before adding **big mileage** where possible (frequency is safer than “one huge run”).

### Long run progression

* Base: long run mostly easy; build duration slowly.
* Specific: introduce segments (progression, MP blocks) for HM/Marathon; for 5K/10K keep it simpler.

### Intensity progression (a simple ladder)

Strides/hills → threshold → VO₂max / race-pace specificity → sharpening
(For marathon: threshold + MP become the core; VO₂max is supplementary.)

### Deload weeks

* Reduce volume ~15–30%, keep a touch of intensity (shorter workouts).
* Use deloads proactively for athletes with high life stress.

## 6) Distance-Specific Emphases and “Signature” Workouts

### 5K: speed endurance + aerobic power + economy

**Primary limiting factors:** aerobic power, economy at fast pace, ability to tolerate high intensity
**Plan emphasis**

* Keep easy volume consistent
* 1 threshold-ish session often helps even for 5K
* 1 VO₂max/5K-specific session most weeks in the specific phase
* Strides/hill sprints year-round

**Workout types**

* VO₂max intervals (3–5 min)
* 5K-pace intervals (e.g., 6–12 x 400–1,000m style work)
* Short hills / strides for economy

**Long run**

* Present but not dominant; usually easy, moderate duration

---

### 10K: threshold strength + aerobic development + some speed

**Primary limiting factors:** threshold / critical speed, aerobic strength, ability to hold “hard steady”
**Plan emphasis**

* Threshold is often the key driver
* VO₂max touches help, but threshold density is central
* Medium-long run becomes useful

**Workout types**

* Cruise intervals (e.g., repeated 5–8 min threshold)
* 10K-pace reps (e.g., 1–2K repeats)
* Occasional shorter reps for economy

**Long run**

* Moderate and consistent; sometimes a gentle progression late

---

### Half Marathon: threshold durability + aerobic volume + pace control

**Primary limiting factors:** ability to sustain near-threshold for long duration; fatigue resistance
**Plan emphasis**

* Threshold and “steady aerobic” work are highly productive
* Long run becomes a major lever, including controlled segments
* Fueling practice begins (especially for slower athletes)

**Workout types**

* Longer tempos / broken tempos (20–50 min total)
* HM-pace blocks (e.g., 2–3 x 15–20 min at HM effort)
* Long run with steady finish or HM-pace segments

**Long run**

* Longer, often with a structured progression in specific phase

---

### Marathon: aerobic volume + marathon pace durability + fueling + fatigue resistance

**Primary limiting factors:** glycogen management, musculoskeletal breakdown, pacing errors, fueling, endurance under fatigue
**Plan emphasis**

* Sustained volume and frequency
* Marathon pace work carefully dosed and progressed
* Threshold remains important but is usually less frequent than for 10K/HM
* Fueling/hydration is a “workout” in itself

**Workout types**

* MP blocks in long runs (e.g., 2 x 20–40 min MP within LR)
* Medium-long runs with steady/MP segments
* Sub-threshold/threshold session to maintain “ceiling”
* Occasional shorter faster work for economy (strides, short intervals)

**Long run**

* Central feature; build to multiple long efforts; avoid making every long run a race

## 7) Typical Plan Lengths and High-Level Structures

Below are common plan durations and what they usually emphasize. In practice, the athlete’s background dictates whether you truly need all phases.

### 8-week plan (short build; assumes decent base)

**Best for:** athletes already training consistently
**Structure**

* Weeks 1–2: re-stabilize routine, light quality, strides
* Weeks 3–6: main build (2 key workouts most weeks)
* Weeks 7–8: sharpen + taper

**Risk:** trying to add too much volume; keep changes targeted.

---

### 10–12 week plan (standard for 5K/10K; workable for HM with base)

**Structure**

* Base-lite (2–4 weeks): volume/frequency + threshold introduction
* Build (4–6 weeks): expand threshold + VO₂max / race pace
* Specific/peak (2–3 weeks): race-pace emphasis
* Taper (1–2 weeks): freshen

---

### 12–16 week plan (common HM; minimum practical marathon for experienced athletes)

**Structure**

* Base (3–6 weeks): volume durability + strides + threshold foundation
* Build (4–6 weeks): threshold density + long-run progression
* Specific (3–4 weeks): HM pace blocks or MP blocks
* Taper (1–2 weeks HM; 2–3 marathon)

---

### 16–20 week plan (marathon standard; or big HM rebuild)

**Structure**

* Foundation (4–6 weeks): frequency, volume ramp, strength, strides
* Marathon/HM build (6–8 weeks): threshold + steady + long run progression
* Specific (4–6 weeks): MP/HM pace durability; key long runs; fueling practice
* Taper (2–3 weeks): reduce volume; maintain intensity “touches”

**Note:** For marathon, the plan’s success often hinges on whether the athlete had an adequate pre-plan base. Without it, the early weeks become “prehab + consistency building,” not aggressive volume.

---

## 8) How to Scale Plans Across Ability Levels (Without Writing Fixed Plans)

### What changes with ability is often “capacity,” not the categories

Across levels, you still use easy, threshold, intervals, long runs, and strides. What changes:

* **Total volume and frequency**
* **Amount of quality** (and how often)
* **Length of long run**
* **Density** (shorter recoveries, more continuous work)
* **Specificity** (more race-pace minutes for advanced athletes)

### Practical scaling levers you can apply to any session

When adjusting workouts for different athletes, vary:

* Total time at intensity (e.g., 15 min vs 40 min threshold)
* Rep count / rep duration (e.g., 4 x 5 min vs 8 x 5 min)
* Recovery duration (more for novices; less for advanced)
* Terrain (hills to reduce impact for some athletes)
* Placement (only one hard session/week when needed)

### The “minimum effective dose” mindset

Especially for injury-prone athletes:

* Keep intensity, reduce volume (or vice versa), but avoid pushing both simultaneously.
* Make the long run easy before making it long-and-hard.

## 9) Common Design Errors (and How to Prevent Them)

1. **Too much moderate running (“gray zone”)**

   * Fix: enforce truly easy days; make hard days meaningfully hard but controlled.

2. **Every long run becomes a test**

   * Fix: alternate “easy long” with “quality long”; respect recovery weeks.

3. **Workouts don’t match the event**

   * Fix: move from general fitness to specific demands as the plan progresses.

4. **Intensity stacked without recovery**

   * Fix: separate hard days; keep easy days easy; include deloads.

5. **Taper is either too big or not real**

   * Fix: reduce volume; maintain frequency; keep short intensity touches.

6. **Ignoring strength and tissue capacity**

   * Fix: schedule strength early in the week or after easy days; taper strength load near race.

## 10) A Practical “Recipe” for Building Any Plan

1. **Define constraints**

   * Race distance, weeks available, target race date, training days, injury history, current weekly volume.

2. **Choose phase durations**

   * Base / Build / Specific / Taper, appropriate to the athlete and race.

3. **Set weekly anchors**

   * Long run day
   * 1–2 quality days
   * Strength days
   * Rest / low-impact day if needed

4. **Select intensity emphasis by race**

   * 5K: VO₂max + 5K pace + supporting threshold
   * 10K: threshold emphasis + 10K pace + economy
   * HM: threshold durability + HM pace + long-run structure
   * Marathon: volume + MP durability + fueling + threshold maintenance

5. **Plan progressions and deloads**

   * Volume, long run, workout minutes, density.

6. **Write workouts using scalable parameters**

   * “Total minutes at threshold,” “total minutes at RP,” “long run with X minutes steady,” etc.

7. **Validate the plan**

   * Does it fit the athlete’s life?
   * Are easy days truly easy?
   * Is there a clear ramp and clear taper?
   * Are the hardest sessions placed when the athlete is ready for them?
