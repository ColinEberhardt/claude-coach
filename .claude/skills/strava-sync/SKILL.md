# Strava Training Log Sync

## Overview

This skill downloads training data from Strava and creates weekly markdown summaries in the `training-log` folder. Each week is stored as a single markdown file with detailed activity summaries, including lap details for runs marked as workouts.

## Workflow

### 1. Get Week Number from User

First, ask the user to provide the training week number:

- Prompt: "Which training week would you like to sync? (e.g., 1, 2, 3)"
- Store this number as the week identifier
- The file will be saved as `week-{n}.md` where {n} is this week number

### 2. Check Strava Connection

Verify that Strava is connected:

```bash
# Check connection status
```

Use the `mcp__strava__check-strava-connection` tool to verify the connection. If not connected, use `mcp__strava__connect-strava` to authenticate.

### 3. Fetch Recent Activities

Retrieve the last 7 days of activities from Strava:

1. Use `mcp__strava__get-recent-activities` to fetch recent activities (default 30 activities)
2. Filter activities to only those from the last 7 days
3. Calculate the week date range (e.g., "2024-01-15 to 2024-01-21")

### 4. Process Each Activity

For each activity in the last week:

1. Extract key information:
   - Activity name
   - Date and time
   - Activity type (Run, Ride, Swim, etc.)
   - Distance (convert to miles or km)
   - Duration (format as HH:MM:SS)
   - Elevation gain
   - Average pace/speed
   - Average heart rate (if available)
   - Description/notes

2. Check if the activity is marked as a workout:
   - Look for the `workout_type` field in the activity data
   - For runs: workout_type 0 = default run, 1 = race, 2 = long run, 3 = workout

3. For workout or long runs, fetch lap details:
   - Use `mcp__strava__get-activity-laps` with the activity ID
   - Extract lap information:
     - Lap number
     - Distance
     - Duration
     - Average pace
     - Average heart rate
     - Elevation gain

### 5. Calculate Week Totals

**IMPORTANT**: Use Python to calculate all totals to ensure mathematical accuracy. Do NOT calculate totals manually.

Use the `mcp__ide__executeCode` tool or Bash with Python to:
1. Group activities by type (Run, Ride, Swim, etc.)
2. For each activity type, calculate:
   - Total distance
   - Total time
   - Total elevation gain
   - Activity count
3. Calculate overall totals across all activity types

Example Python calculation:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Given activities list
activities = [...]  # Your activities data

# Group by activity type
by_type = defaultdict(list)
for activity in activities:
    activity_type = activity['type']  # e.g., 'Run', 'Ride', 'Swim'
    by_type[activity_type].append(activity)

# Calculate totals per activity type
type_totals = {}
for activity_type, activities_of_type in by_type.items():
    total_distance = sum(a['distance'] for a in activities_of_type)  # in meters
    total_time = sum(a['moving_time'] for a in activities_of_type)  # in seconds
    total_elevation = sum(a['total_elevation_gain'] for a in activities_of_type)  # in meters
    count = len(activities_of_type)
    
    # Convert to display units
    distance_miles = total_distance * 0.000621371
    hours = total_time // 3600
    minutes = (total_time % 3600) // 60
    seconds = total_time % 60
    elevation_feet = total_elevation * 3.28084
    
    type_totals[activity_type] = {
        'count': count,
        'distance': f"{distance_miles:.2f} miles",
        'time': f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}",
        'elevation': f"{elevation_feet:.0f} ft"
    }

# Calculate overall totals
total_distance = sum(a['distance'] for a in activities)
total_time = sum(a['moving_time'] for a in activities)
total_elevation = sum(a['total_elevation_gain'] for a in activities)
total_count = len(activities)

# Convert to display units
overall_distance_miles = total_distance * 0.000621371
overall_hours = total_time // 3600
overall_minutes = (total_time % 3600) // 60
overall_seconds = total_time % 60
overall_elevation_feet = total_elevation * 3.28084

print(f"Overall Total Activities: {total_count}")
print(f"Overall Total Distance: {overall_distance_miles:.2f} miles")
print(f"Overall Total Time: {overall_hours:02d}:{overall_minutes:02d}:{overall_seconds:02d}")
print(f"Overall Total Elevation: {overall_elevation_feet:.0f} ft")
print("\nBy Activity Type:")
for activity_type, totals in type_totals.items():
    print(f"\n{activity_type}:")
    print(f"  Count: {totals['count']}")
    print(f"  Distance: {totals['distance']}")
    print(f"  Time: {totals['time']}")
    print(f"  Elevation: {totals['elevation']}")
```

### 6. Format as Markdown

Create a markdown file with the following structure, using the calculated totals:

```markdown
# Training Log: [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Week Summary

### Overall Totals
- **Total Activities**: [count from calculation]
- **Total Distance**: [distance from calculation] miles/km
- **Total Time**: [duration from calculation]
- **Total Elevation**: [elevation from calculation] ft/m

### By Activity Type

#### Run
- **Activities**: [count]
- **Distance**: [distance] miles
- **Time**: [HH:MM:SS]
- **Elevation**: [elevation] ft

#### Ride
- **Activities**: [count]
- **Distance**: [distance] miles
- **Time**: [HH:MM:SS]
- **Elevation**: [elevation] ft

[Include sections for each activity type present in the week]

## Activities

### [Date] - [Activity Name]

**Type**: [Run/Ride/Swim/etc.]
**Distance**: [distance] mi
**Duration**: [HH:MM:SS]
**Pace**: [pace per mile/km]
**Elevation**: [elevation] ft
**Heart Rate**: [avg bpm] (max: [max bpm])

[Activity description/notes if available]

#### Lap Details

| Lap | Distance | Time | Pace | HR | Elevation |
|-----|----------|------|------|-----|-----------|
| 1   | [dist]   | [time] | [pace] | [hr] | [elev] |
| 2   | [dist]   | [time] | [pace] | [hr] | [elev] |

---

[Continue for each activity...]
```

### 7. Save to training-log Folder

1. Create the `training-log` folder if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p training-log
   ```

2. Generate filename using the week number provided by the user:
   - Format: `week-{n}.md` where {n} is the week number
   - Example: `week-1.md`, `week-2.md`, `week-3.md`, etc.

3. Write the markdown content to the file

### 8. Provide Summary

After syncing, provide a brief summary:
- Week number
- Number of activities synced
- Date range covered
- File location (e.g., `training-log/week-1.md`)
- Any activities that are workouts with lap details
- Confirm that totals were calculated using Python/script

## MCP Tools Used

- `mcp__strava__check-strava-connection`: Verify Strava authentication
- `mcp__strava__connect-strava`: Connect to Strava if needed
- `mcp__strava__get-recent-activities`: Fetch recent activities
- `mcp__strava__get-activity-details`: Get detailed info for specific activities (if needed)
- `mcp__strava__get-activity-laps`: Fetch lap details for workout runs

## Error Handling

- If Strava is not connected, prompt user to authenticate
- If no activities found in the last week, inform the user
- If lap details are unavailable, note this in the markdown
- Handle API rate limits gracefully

## Notes

- The skill focuses on the last 7 days of data
- Workout detection is specific to runs (workout_type field)
- Lap details are only fetched for activities marked as workouts
- Distance and pace units should match user preference (miles vs km)
- All times should be in local time zone
